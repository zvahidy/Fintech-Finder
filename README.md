# Fintech-Finder
I currently work at a startup that is building a new and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As Fintech Finderâ€™s lead developer, I have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable our customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.
I have created a code that enables our customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, I assumed the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.
